        Roses are iconic flowers often associated with love, passion, and beauty.
        Their long history of cultivation has made them popular symbols in 
        literature, art, and culture. The different colors of roses represent 
        various emotions; red signifies romantic love, white symbolizes purity,
        yellow stands for friendship, and pink conveys admiration. Known for
        their delicate petals and pleasant fragrance, roses are frequently
        given on special occasions like Valentine's Day and anniversaries.
        Their thorny stems remind us that love, too, has its challenges.
        Roses also have medicinal properties and are used in beauty 
        products, making them a timeless symbol of affection.
