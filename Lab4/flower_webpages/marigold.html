        Marigolds are known for their vibrant orange and yellow hues, symbolizing
        warmth, creativity, and passion. These flowers are widely used in 
        ceremonies and festivals across various cultures, especially in South 
        Asia and Latin America. In India, marigolds are often used in religious 
        rituals and garlands, symbolizing devotion. In Mexico, they are associated
        with the Day of the Dead, where they guide spirits back to the living 
        world. Marigolds are also known for their pest-repelling properties, 
        making them popular in gardens. Their resilience and bright color 
        represent the power of the sun and the cycle of life and death.
