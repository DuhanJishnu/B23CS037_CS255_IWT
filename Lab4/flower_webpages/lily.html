    <p>
        The Lily is often associated with purity, virtue, and renewal. 
        Its elegant, trumpet-shaped flowers are admired for their beauty and 
        fragrance. In various cultures, lilies symbolize different things, 
        such as motherhood in ancient Greece and Christianity, where the white 
        lily represents the Virgin Mary. With their stunning blooms, lilies are 
        popular in weddings and formal events. Lilies come in many colors, each 
        representing distinct emotions, such as white for purity, pink for 
        admiration, and yellow for joy. These perennials are also known for 
        their ability to grow back every year, symbolizing hope and rebirth.
