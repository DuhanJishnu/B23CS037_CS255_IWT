    <h1>Sunflower - Symbol of Positivity</h1>

    <p>
        Sunflowers are known for their striking yellow petals and their ability 
        to follow the sun across the sky, a phenomenon called heliotropism. This 
        characteristic symbolizes positivity, loyalty, and long life. Originating 
        from North America, sunflowers have been cultivated for centuries, 
        primarily for their seeds and oil. The sunflower's vibrant appearance 
        and towering height make it a favorite in gardens and floral arrangements.
        Besides their visual appeal, they are also environmentally beneficial, 
        as they can absorb toxic substances from the soil. The sunflower's 
        bright, cheerful nature often evokes feelings of happiness and optimism.
